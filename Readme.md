                   |  +---+   +---+      |  
                   |      . . . . .      |
                   |  +---+   +---+      |

                   +---------------------+

                   +---------------------+
                   |      Wireless       |
                   |    Access Point      |
                   +---------------------+
### Explanation

1. Wired Connection:
   - Ethernet: Each assembly unit can use wired Ethernet to connect all components (e.g., sensors, actuators) within the unit. This ensures high-speed, reliable communication over short distances.

2. Wireless Connection:
   - Wireless Access Point: A wireless access point can be used to connect mobile devices, laptops, or other assembly line components that may need flexibility in movement or aren't directly wired. 

3. Network Switch: A network switch facilitates communication between wired assembly units and can connect to the wireless access point to integrate both network types seamlessly.

### b. Recommended Connection Strategy

Recommended Strategy: Zigbee

Justification:
- Low Power Consumption: Zigbee is designed for low power usage, which is crucial in manufacturing settings to extend the life of battery-operated devices.
- Mesh Networking: Zigbee can create a mesh network, allowing components to communicate with each other efficiently over larger distances by relaying signals.
- Robustness: Suitable for environments with many devices (100 components per assembly unit) and can handle the dense network required without significant interference.
- Scalability: Easily supports the addition of more components or devices without requiring extensive changes to the existing network.

## B. Publisher-Subscriber Model in Embedded Networks

### Role and Importance

The publisher-subscriber model is essential in embedded networks as it facilitates decoupled communication between components. This model allows devices (publishers) to send data or notifications without needing to know which devices (subscribers) are receiving the data. This increases flexibility and scalability in network design.

### Types of Publisher-Subscriber Models

1. Simple Publish-Subscribe:
   - Description: Basic model where publishers send messages to a topic, and subscribers receive messages from that topic without any prior knowledge of each other.
   - Use Case: Simple messaging systems where many devices need updates simultaneously.
